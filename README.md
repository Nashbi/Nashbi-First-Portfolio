# Portfolio
<h3> Nashbi's first version of his professional portfolio<h3>
      <p> This portfolio contains two projects Nashbi has been working on since he's begun his higher education study at The Georgia Institue of Technology </p>
<h3> "Effective Refactoring Project"<h3>
      <p> There's a refactoring project where he deployed a repository containing highly efficient refactoring that displayed industry standard knowledge and skills on effective SEO and accessibility. </p>

<h3> "Forward & Beyond, Non-Profit Client" </h3>
      <p> This project is a paid project Nashbi had to complete during the duration of this course. A client hired him to produce an effective website that had the capabilities of accepting donations, displaying a highly responsive layout, and producing an effective overall design. Though given a sharp deadline he was able to develop and deploy an effective website to the web via wix. To prevent an empty portfolio, Nashbi included this second piece within his portfolio as it displays accurately, his most recent work. </p>
